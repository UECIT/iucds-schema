## Generating the Java model from the schema

* Download the CDS Schema from the [NHS Connect Github](https://github.com/nhsconnect/Integrated-Urgent-Care)
  * Description of schema files is located on [a github.io page](https://nhsconnect.github.io/Integrated-Urgent-Care/Publish/Domains/messages.html) (published from the above repo)
* Download the [XMLBeans binary distribution](https://xmlbeans.apache.org/download/index.html#XMLBeans+Binary+and+Development+Kit)

```shell script
XMLBEANS_ROOT=[xmlbeans_root] ./generate.sh
```

This will remove and regenerate all Java classes for the schema
